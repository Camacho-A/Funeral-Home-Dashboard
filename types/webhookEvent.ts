/**
 * Phase 19B (Clover Hosted Checkout Integration) — final durability
 * correction. A `WebhookEventRecord` is Solis's own durable record of
 * "have I already, successfully finished processing this exact webhook
 * event" — distinct from a `PaymentRecord`, which tracks the *payment's*
 * lifecycle. Conflating the two (the previous design: a bare presence
 * check on the fingerprint) meant a webhook whose signature verified but
 * whose downstream PaymentRecord update failed would permanently "claim"
 * the fingerprint — any later retry from Clover would be silently
 * acknowledged without ever actually applying the update. This type
 * exists so "claimed" and "successfully completed" are different,
 * durably-persisted states. See
 * docs/adr/ADR-022-clover-hosted-checkout-integration.md and
 * services/paymentsService.ts's claimWebhookEvent/markWebhookEventCompleted/
 * markWebhookEventFailed.
